These were 3 case study projects. Our main goal was to use R code to achieve the following: import the data, tidy up and organize the data, generate graphs to better visualize the relationships between variables, fit the data model to further identify the relationship, use statistical inferencce to arrive at a conclusion. Explainations of the code can be found under each line of code.
